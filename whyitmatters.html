   <p <div> Bees are important for pollination The most important thing that bees do is pollinate. </div>
    <div> Pollination is needed for plants to reproduce, and so many plants depend on bees or other insects as pollinators.</div>
   <p Honey also has antiseptic and antibacterial properties.
       <div>
         When a bee collects nectar and pollen from the flower of a plant,
          some pollen from the stamens—the male reproductive organ of the
          flower—sticks to the hairs of her body. When she visits the next flower,
           some of this pollen is rubbed off onto the stigma, or tip of the pistil—the female reproductive organ of the flower.
           When this happens, fertilization is possible, and a fruit, carrying seeds, can develop. </div>


           <p> Healthy for your heart- <div>
              The vast majority of plants we need for food rely on pollination ,
               by bees: from almonds and vanilla and apples to squashes.
                We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those
                 plants and so on up the food chain. </div>
