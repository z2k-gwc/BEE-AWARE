      <strong><h2> Intresting Facts about Honey</strong> </h2> <br>
      <br>
      1. A typical beehive can produce anywhere from 30 to 100 pounds of honey a year.<br>
       To produce a single pound of honey, a colony of bees must collect nectar from approximately <br>
       two million flowers and fly over 55,000 miles. This amounts to a lifetime’s worth of work for around 800 bees.
       <br>
      2. In 11th century Germany, honey was so highly valued for its beer-sweetening abilities that<br>
       German feudal lords required their peasants to make them payments of honey and beeswax. <br>
       3. Bees work hard all summer to ensure they’ll have enough honey <br> to sustain the hive through the winter. During the colder months, bees occupy their time by clustering themselves <br>
      around the queen and shivering their bodies to fill the hive with warmth. All that shivering burns a lot of calories, so honey makes for the perfect high-energy diet.
