  <h3> Interesting Facts about Honey</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> A typical beehive can produce anywhere from 30 to 100 pounds of honey a year.
       To produce a single pound of honey, a colony of bees must collect nectar from approximately
       two million flowers and fly over 55,000 miles. This amounts to an entire lifetime of work for around 800 bees.</li>
      <li> In 11th century Germany, honey was so highly valued for its beer-sweetening abilities that
       German feudal lords required their peasants to make them payments of honey and beeswax.</li>
      <li> Bees work hard all summer to ensure they will have enough honey to sustain the hive through the winter. During the colder months, bees occupy their time by clustering themselves
      around the queen and shivering their bodies to fill the hive with warmth. All that shivering burns a lot of calories, so honey makes for the perfect high-energy diet.</li>
