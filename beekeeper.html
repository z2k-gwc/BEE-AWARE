        Are you looking for a way to remove your bees without harming the environment?
        This is the place for you<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>We at Bee - Aware</b> believe that it is important to remove bees when they are a
        danger to the household. However, we also believe that bees should be removed safely
        and by a professional who will relocate the bees so that they can continue to
        live.

        Step 1: Make sure that you are dealing with bees.<br>
          - It is important to make the distinction between bees and wasps or hornets
          the former contributes to pollinating plants, flowers, and our food source, while
          the latter are just pests. Wasps and hornets are also agressive so it is important
          to be aware of which insect you are dealing with.<br>
        Step 2: Call a local beekeeper or bee remmoval company<br>
          - Using local beekeepers is usually more preferable to calling exterminators.
          Bees are important to our environments so depite the added difficulty of removing
          bees without killing them it is definitely worth it. We have provided a list
          of local Houston bee removal specialists.
